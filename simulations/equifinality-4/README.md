# README for Equifinality-4 #

The equifinality-4 analysis uses the simulation results from equifinality-3, but 
I needed to calculate additional derived statistics from the database in doing 
data export.  Thus, only the analysis scripts change.  Please refer to the 
equifinality-3 directory for configuration files for simulation data.
