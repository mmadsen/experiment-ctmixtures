The CTMixtures analysis is designed to be replicable given the output from simulation models.  The analysis 
is not in the form of a single RMarkdown document, however, because classification model fitting is a lengthy
process on a computing cluster.  Thus, the analysis is broken into three stages:

1.  Data preparation --  located in "postsimulation" directory
1.  Model fitting --  located in "modelfitting" directory
1.  Fit post-processing --  located in "postmodelfitting" directory
1.  Results --  located in "paperanalysis" directory

The output of the scripts in the "paperanalysis" directory are intended for inclusion directly in publications and finished results.
